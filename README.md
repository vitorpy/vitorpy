I've been around the block a few times, wearing hats from engineer to CTO. I even had a stint at a VC firm, but let's not hold that against me. ðŸ™ˆ

I've also tried my hand at founding a couple of companies. My first, SIM, used computer vision for materials science (RIP). The second was [Pillar](https://pillar.fi), an Ethereum wallet.

I spent a couple years on [SPRING](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/), an open source GIS with amazing image processing capabilities. Biometrics, particularly fingerprints, also caught my eye for a bit. It was a fun challenge, and you can find a [few old projects](https://github.com/vitorpy/qwsqviewer) from that time here on GitHub.

Since 2017 (with a brief detour at Big Tech!), blockchain projects have become my main jam. Decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized identity are areas I'm particularly passionate about.
