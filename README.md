I'm a seasoned engineer and founder with a passion for building decentralized solutions. I've dabbled in everything from computer vision to biometrics, but my heart lies in the world of Web3. 

My current focus is on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized identity. I'm proficient in Solidity, smart contract development, and building secure, user-friendly dApps.

**Let's build the future of Web3 together!** Open to exciting projects and collaborations. ü§ù
